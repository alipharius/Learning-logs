# Learning-logs

Weekly learning logs of my progress learning Python and data science.

This repo is intentionally lightweight:
- **Weeks**: one Markdown file per week (created at the start of the week, updated at the end)
- **Artifacts**: each week includes at least one link to something I made (code, notebook, snippet, plot, notes)
- **Projects**: larger work lives in other repositories

This is my “learning in public” log: I document progress, mistakes, and small outputs instead of learning silently,
Each week is a single file that I **start at the beginning of the week** and **complete at the end** .
